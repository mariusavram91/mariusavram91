## Hi there, I'm Marius! üëã

I am a **Product-Oriented Software Developer** and tech enthusiast with over a decade of experience (_Django, Rails, FastAPI, Vue, React, Typescript, Docker, and more_). I like building things and helping people. Currently, founder at Otterly (Project Management Platform for freelancers).

Right now he is stuck in an inifinite `while` loop waiting for treats and pets.
